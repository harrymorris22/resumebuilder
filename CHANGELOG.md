# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Before/after resume diff** — after accepting an AI suggestion in the Refine step, a "Show Changes" toggle appears. Flip it to see exactly what changed: removed text crossed out in red, new text highlighted in green. Word-level precision so you can see individual keyword swaps, not just "something changed."
- `diffWords` utility using LCS algorithm for word-level diffing
- `DiffText` component rendering inline red/green diff spans
- `DiffResumePreview` component showing section-by-section diff across summary, experience, skills, education, and projects
- 17 new tests covering diff utility, diff components, and RefineStep toggle behavior

## [0.4.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **CV generation no longer fabricates content** — generated resumes now use your exact content pool text, word for word. Previously, the AI could rewrite bullets, invent summaries, and add skills not in your pool. Now it selects from your pool only, skipping sections with no matching content.

## [0.4.0.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Wizard-based UI** replacing the two-panel + chat layout with a guided 5-step flow: Content Pool, AI Recommendations, Job Description, Generate CV, Refine
- **Step-by-step navigation** with progress indicator, back/next buttons, and step gates
- **AI Recommendations** (Step 2) analyzes your content pool and suggests improvements inline
- **Job Description analysis** (Step 3) extracts keywords and generates JD-specific recommendations
- **CV Generation** (Step 4) creates a new 1-page resume from your content pool, targeted to the job description, with section-by-section progress checklist
- **Refine step** (Step 5) with JD-specific AI suggestions and prominent export
- **Resume Library drawer** accessible from header, showing all generated resumes grouped by job application
- **Job description persistence** with saved JD list, keyword extraction, and select/delete
- **Empty states** for all wizard steps with clear calls-to-action

### Changed
- Header simplified (removed ResumeMenu dropdown and TemplateSelector, added "My Resumes" button)
- DESIGN.md updated for wizard-based layout
- Recommendations and job descriptions now persist to IndexedDB (survive page refresh)

### Removed
- Floating chat drawer (FloatingChat, ChatPanel, ActionPanel, MessageBubble)
- Split pane two-panel layout
- Content Bank drawer (replaced by Content Pool in wizard)
- Mode toggle (general/job-customisation)
- Coach notes and resume score components

### Fixed
- "Add Manually" button on empty content pool now shows the full ContentPoolPage

## [0.3.9.3] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **"e.keywords.join is not a function" crash** — `analyze_job_description` tool handler assumed `keywords` was always an array, but Claude sometimes returns a comma-separated string; now handles both formats gracefully

## [0.3.9.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Generate Recommendations button** now triggers AI analysis (was missing onClick handler after UI refactor)
- **Analyze Job Description button** now sends job description to AI for resume tailoring (was an empty callback)
- **AI Coach drawer auto-opens** when recommendations are triggered from the content pool page
- Button disables while a recommendation request is pending to prevent duplicate requests

## [0.3.9.1] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Empty sections hidden from resume** — sections with no content (skills, certifications, projects, experience, education, summary, custom) no longer render on the resume, keeping the layout clean

## [0.3.9.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Page-accurate resume preview** — preview padding now matches print CSS exactly (`0.5in` instead of Tailwind `p-8`), so what you see is what you print
- **Page overflow indicator** — dashed amber boundary line at the one-page mark and amber warning bar when content overflows: "Content overflows one page. Remove items to fit."
- **Overflow detection tests** — `ResumePreview.test.tsx` with 3 tests covering no-overflow, overflow-detected, and boundary-line-hidden states

### Changed
- Page boundary line is hidden in `@media print` so it never appears in exported PDFs

## [0.3.8.0] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **PDF export matches preview** — replaced react-pdf/renderer (separate layout with mismatched fonts and styles) with `window.print()` targeting `#resume-print-area`; print CSS uses `visibility: hidden` isolation so only the active resume template renders, pixel-perfect match with what the user sees
- **Reset confirmation dialog null guard** — closing the confirm dialog when `activeResumeId` is null no longer leaves the dialog stuck open

## [0.3.7.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Reset resume** — "Reset content" option in the resume menu clears all resume sections back to defaults while leaving the content pool untouched; two-step confirm (amber) with "Cannot be undone." warning prevents accidental data loss
- `resetResume` store action — replaces sections with fresh defaults, persists to IDB

### Fixed
- Reset confirmation dialog no longer gets stuck open when `activeResumeId` is null

## [0.3.6.1] - 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Duplicate bullets in resume preview** — checking a bullet in the content pool when experience entries already existed could push the same bullet multiple times due to direct state mutation and a missing deduplication guard
- **State mutation bug** — `addPoolItemToResume` and `removePoolItemFromResume` now clone arrays before mutating, preventing Zustand from missing updates
- **Startup cleanup** — `hydrateFromIdb` deduplicates any already-corrupted bullet arrays on first load, so existing data heals automatically

## [0.3.6.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Editable job headers** — click any job header field (title, company, start date, end date) to edit inline; changes propagate to all bullets in that job group
- **"Present" for current roles** — end date shows "Present" when null; typing "Present" stores null
- `allowEmpty` option on `EditableText` — enables clearing the start date field (previously a cleared value was silently discarded)

### Fixed
- **Empty start date now saveable** — clearing a job's start date previously did nothing silently; the field now saves correctly
- **Type-safe field updates** — context field parameter is now typed as a union (`'title' | 'company' | 'startDate' | 'endDate'`) instead of `string`, preventing silent typo-induced corruption

## [0.3.5.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Pool section order synced with resume** — content pool sections display in the same order as the resume sections
- **Drag-and-drop section reorder** — drag section headers in the pool to reorder; resume preview updates to match
- **Drag-and-drop item reorder** — drag individual bullets within a job or items within any section to reorder
- **reorderPoolEntries** store action for persisting item-level reordering
- **Seed Test Data** button for development testing (visible when pool is empty)

### Fixed
- Job chronological sorting now parses "Mon YYYY" date formats correctly (was doing alphabetical comparison)
- Experience items added to resume via checkbox now sort chronologically (newest first)

### Changed
- Applied DESIGN.md design system across entire UI (fonts, colors, warm grays)

## [0.3.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- Applied DESIGN.md design system across entire UI
- Font: Inter → Instrument Sans (body) + Satoshi (headings) + Geist Mono (data)
- Primary color: indigo (#6366f1) → blue (#2563EB) per design system
- Neutrals: cool gray → warm gray (stone palette) across all 44 components
- Font imports via Fontshare CDN + Google Fonts with font-display: swap
